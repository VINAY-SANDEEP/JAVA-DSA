## 🎉 Welcome Everyone!

I am excited to share this **Java Learning Roadmap** that will guide you through mastering Java step by step. This roadmap covers everything from Java fundamentals to advanced topics and data structures. By following this journey, you'll gain the skills to confidently tackle real-world problems, including coding challenges on platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

> This tutorial is designed for anyone who wants to **learn Java comprehensively** and **become proficient in DSA**.

## 🦾 Basic Topics

- **Print Statement** (`System.out.println()`) - Output function
- **Data Types** - Primitive and non-primitive
- **Operators** - Arithmetic, relational, logical, etc.
- **Scanner** - Taking input from the user
- **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`)
- **Ternary Operator**
- **Loops** (`for`, `while`, `do while`)
- **Arrays** - 1D and 2D
- **Strings & StringBuilder** - Manipulating text
- **Methods (Functions)** - Creating reusable code
- **ArrayList & Vectors** - Dynamic data structures

---

## 🦾 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Cyclic Sort
- **Recursion**: Understanding base cases and recursive calls
- **Sorting Techniques**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- **Advanced Recursion**: Strings, patterns, backtracking, mazes, N-Queens, N-Knights

> _After completing DSA basics, it's time to dive into OOP concepts._

## 🦾 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Classes & Objects** - Building blocks of OOP
- **Constructors** - Initializing objects
- **Keywords**: `this`, `final`, `super`
- **Packages** - Organizing code
- **Static & Non-Static Members** - Shared vs. instance members
- **Singleton Class** - Ensuring a class has only one instance
- **Inheritance** (`extends`) - Code reuse and relationships
- **Polymorphism** - Method overloading and overriding
- **Encapsulation** - Data hiding and getters/setters
- **Abstraction** - Abstract classes and methods
- **Interfaces** - Achieving multiple inheritance
- **Annotations** (`@Override`) - Enhancing code readability
- **Lambda Expressions** - Functional programming style
- **Exception Handling** - `try`, `catch`, `finally` for robustness
- **Enums** - Representing fixed sets of constants
- **Collection Framework** - Efficient data handling

---

## 🦾 Advanced DSA Topics

- **Linked List**: Singly, doubly linked lists
- **Stacks & Queues**: LIFO and FIFO structures
- **Trees**: Binary Trees, AVL Trees
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, shortest path
- **Heaps**: Max-heaps and Min-heaps
- **HashMaps**: Key-value pairs for efficient lookups
- **Segment Trees**: Range queries and updates
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Count Sort, Radix Sort
