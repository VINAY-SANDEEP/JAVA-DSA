        <li><span>Class : </span> A blueprint or template in Java that defines the structure and behavior (fields and methods) of objects.</li>
        <li><span>Object : </span> An instance of a class that holds data and can perform actions defined by its class.</li>
        <li><span>Constructor : </span>A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects, typically called when an object of a class is created, and it has the same name as the class.</li>
         <li><span>This(keyword) : </span>The this keyword in Java is used to refer to the current instance of a class, helping to distinguish between instance variables and parameters, or to call other constructors within the same class </li>
         <li><span>Wapper clases : </span>A wrapper class in Java provides an object representation of primitive data types, allowing primitives like int, char, double, etc., to be treated as objects (e.g., Integer, Character, Double).</li>
         <ol>
                Byte (for byte) ,
                Short (for short),
                Integer (for int),
                Long (for long),
                Float (for float),
                Double (for double),
                Character (for char),
                Boolean (for boolean),

        <li><span>Packages : </span> In Java, a package is a namespace that groups related classes and interfaces together, helping to organize code, avoid name conflicts, and control access levels.</li>
        <li>it is also know as folder</li>
        <li><span>static : </span> used to indicate that a method, variable, or block belongs to the class rather than instances of the class, allowing it to be accessed without creating an object of the class.</li>
        <li><span>Non-static : </span> a non-static method or variable belongs to an instance of a class, meaning it requires creating an object of the class to be accessed or used.</li>
        <ul><span id="key">Key Differences:</span>
         <li><span id="key">Static Method: </span>Called using the class name (no object required).</li>
        <li><span id="key">Non-Static Method: </span>Called using an object of the class (object required).</li>
        </ul>
        <li><span>Innerclass :</span>Java is a class defined within another class, used to logically group classes that are only used in one place, or to access the outer class's members (even private ones).</li>
        <ol>
           <li><span id="key">Nested Inner Class: </span> A regular class defined inside another class.</li>
           <li><span id="key">Method-local Inner Class:</span>Defined within a method and can only be accessed within that method.</li>
           <li><span id="key">Anonymous Inner Class:</span>A class without a name, used to instantiate objects with modifications to existing classes or interfaces.</li>
           <li><span id="key">Static Nested Class:</span>A static class inside another class, which can be accessed without an instance of the outer class.</li>
        </ol>

        <li><span>Inheritance : </span>Java is a mechanism where one class (subclass/child) acquires the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class (superclass/parent), promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship.</li>
        <li><span>Encapsulation : </span>Java refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class)</li>
        <li><span>Abstraction : </span>Java is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object, primarily achieved using:</li>
        <ol>
            <li><span id="key">Abstract Classes: </span> Classes that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation).</li>
            <li><span id="key">Interfaces: </span> Purely abstract types that define a contract which classes must follow, without specifying how the methods should be implemented.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><span>Polymorphism : </span> Java is the ability of a single action or method to behave differently based on the object or context. </li>
        <ol>
            <li><span id="key">Compile-time (Method Overloading): </span>Multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameter lists.</li>
            <li><span id="key">Runtime (Method Overriding): </span>A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass, allowing dynamic method dispatch.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
